# Css to the rescue process

## Project discription 
I wil de be experimenting with CSS techniques that are new (to me). I will be  creating an innovative, experimental, and enjoyable experience - using only vanilla HTML and vanilla CSS.

## Week 1

### Brainstorming Ideas 
It was time to start brainstorming some ideas. i went with the theme: **Modular Control panel** so it must controll something. 
I am currently very invested in wellness and different things that can help with improving yourself mentally and physically, so i started researching things we can implement in a controll pannel that can help you with "relaxing" and mindfullness practices. 



- Breathwork/ beathing techniques
- Sight therapy/ mood lighting
- Sounds
These are all things you could controll with the controllpannel to get yourself in the right mind space.
